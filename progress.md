# Progress

- Ensured `skill-manager`, `antigravity-skill-creator`, and `python-scripting` exist in the local project folder (`/Users/jatinbhutani/GitHub/antigravity-skills/skills/`).
- Copied `skill-manager`, `antigravity-skill-creator`, and `python-scripting` to the global AG skills folder (`~/.gemini/antigravity/skills/`).
- Analyzed the `antigravity-skill-creator` to provide the user with the exact procedure for generating a new skill from raw, unformatted data.
