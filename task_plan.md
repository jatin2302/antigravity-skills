# Task Plan
1. Parse the SKILL_INVENTORY.md to map all skills to categories.
2. Generate a Markdown text-based representation of the tree structure.
3. Save the tree view at `/Users/jatinbhutani/GitHub/antigravity-skills/SKILLS_TREE.md` (COMPLETED).
4. Outline the physical reorganization logic (moving 1000+ folders into `skills/category_name/skill_name`).
5. Require explicit User Approval before physical destruction of the flat structure (PENDING).
6. Implement folder moves and update maintenance scripts (`sync-skills.sh`, `update_inventory.py`, etc) to handle hierarchical nested skills instead of the current flat structure.
