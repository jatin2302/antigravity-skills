## Methodology

### Phase 1: Strategic Analysis

**Understand the Intent:**

For each page type, map to searcher intent:

**Informational Intent** (How-to, What is, Guide):
- Structure: Problem → Solution → Steps → Examples → FAQ
- Goal: Answer question completely, build authority
- CTA: Soft (download guide, read related, subscribe)

**Commercial Investigation** (Best, Reviews, Comparison):
- Structure: Overview → Comparison table → Detailed analysis → Recommendation
- Goal: Help decision-making, position offering
- CTA: Medium (request quote, see pricing, schedule demo)

**Transactional Intent** (Service page, Hire, Buy):
- Structure: Hook → Benefits → How it works → Social proof → CTA
- Goal: Convert visitors to customers
- CTA: Strong (get started, buy now, schedule call)

**Navigational Intent** (Location page, About):
- Structure: Overview → Details → Unique value → Contact/Visit
- Goal: Provide specific information sought
- CTA: Location-based (visit us, call us, directions)

**Analyze Competitors:**
- What are top 3 ranking pages covering?
- What are they missing?
- How can we be more comprehensive?
- What unique angle can we take?

### Phase 2: Outline Creation

**SEO-Optimized Outline Structure:**

Every outline includes:

1. **Title (H1):**
   - Includes primary keyword naturally
   - 50-60 characters optimal
   - Compelling, click-worthy
   - Format examples:
     - How-to: "How to [Achieve Result]: [Number] Steps That Work"
     - Service: "[Service] in [Location]: [Unique Benefit]"
     - Comparison: "[X] vs [Y]: Which [Solution] is Right for You?"

2. **Introduction (100-150 words):**
   - Hook with problem/pain point
   - Promise of what page delivers
   - Primary keyword in first 100 words
   - Brief preview of structure

3. **Body Sections (H2s):**
   - 3-7 main sections depending on depth
   - Each H2 targets secondary keyword or LSI term
   - Logical flow following user journey
   - Examples:
     - Service page: What is it → Benefits → How it works → Why us → Pricing → FAQ
     - Blog post: Problem → Root causes → Solutions → Implementation → Results

4. **Subsections (H3s, H4s):**
   - Break complex sections into digestible chunks
   - Target long-tail keyword variations
   - Create natural anchor link opportunities

5. **FAQ Section:**
   - Address common questions (from "People Also Ask")
   - Target question keywords
   - Schema markup opportunity
   - 5-10 Q&As

6. **Conclusion + CTA:**
   - Summarize key points
   - Reinforce main benefit
   - Clear next step with strong CTA

**Outline Quality Checks:**
✅ Primary keyword in title and first H2
✅ Secondary keywords distributed across H2s
✅ Logical flow (user journey makes sense)
✅ Comprehensive (covers topic fully)
✅ Differentiated (unique angle vs competitors)
✅ Conversion opportunities identified

### Phase 3: Content Generation

**Writing Principles:**

**1. Natural Keyword Integration:**
- Primary keyword: 3-5 times total (0.5-1% density)
- In title, first paragraph, one H2, conclusion, URL
- Secondary keywords: 1-2 times each
- LSI terms: Naturally throughout
- NEVER keyword stuff or force awkward phrasing

**2. Readability First:**
- Short paragraphs (2-4 sentences max)
- Active voice > passive voice
- Simple words when possible
- Transition words between sections
- Scannable formatting:
  - Bullet points for lists
  - **Bold** for key terms
  - Numbers for stats
  - Short sentences (15-20 words avg)

**3. Comprehensive Coverage:**
- Answer the question completely
- Anticipate follow-up questions
- Provide context and examples
- Link to related resources
- Don't leave gaps competitors can fill

**4. E-E-A-T Signals:**
- **Experience:** First-person examples, case studies, "we've found that..."
- **Expertise:** Technical details, industry terminology, specific processes
- **Authority:** Citations, data sources, author credentials
- **Trust:** Contact info, transparent about limitations, realistic claims

**5. Conversion Optimization:**
- CTA every 300-500 words
- Vary CTA types (button, link, text)
- Match CTA strength to page type
- Address objections before CTA
- Make next step obvious and easy

**Content Length Guidelines:**
- Service pages: 800-1,500 words
- Location pages: 600-1,000 words
- Blog posts (informational): 1,500-2,500 words
- Comparison pages: 1,200-2,000 words
- Pillar/guide content: 2,500-5,000 words

**Never sacrifice quality for length targets - comprehensive beats long**

### Phase 4: On-Page SEO Optimization

**Meta Tags:**

**Title Tag (50-60 chars):**
```
[Primary Keyword] | [Brand/Modifier] - [Benefit]
```
Examples:
- "Plumber in Boston | 24/7 Emergency Service - Same Day"
- "Best Project Management Software | Trello vs Asana vs Monday"
- "How to Build Backlinks: 15 Strategies That Actually Work"

**Meta Description (150-160 chars):**
- Include primary keyword
- Compelling benefit/hook
- Clear value prop
- Call to action
```
Discover [primary keyword] that [key benefit]. Learn [specific promise]. [CTA like "Get started free" or "Read our guide"]
```

**Open Graph Tags:**
```html
<meta property="og:title" content="[Page Title]">
<meta property="og:description" content="[Meta Description]">
<meta property="og:image" content="[Featured Image URL]">
<meta property="og:url" content="[Page URL]">
```

**URL Structure:**

Best practices:
- Lowercase, hyphens for spaces

## Scale Production Techniques

**For High Volume (10+ pages):**

**1. Template Reuse:**
- Standardize structure for similar page types
- Swap in unique details (location, service, product)
- Maintain quality while increasing speed

**2. Content Matrix:**
- Service + Location grids
- Generate variations systematically
- Ensure each has unique value (not pure spin)

**3. Modular Components:**
- Reusable sections (About Us, Why Choose Us)
- Customize 70%, reuse 30%
- Maintain brand consistency

**4. Quality over Speed:**
- Don't sacrifice uniqueness for volume
- Each page must serve user intent
- Google penalizes thin, duplicate content

**Thin Content Warning:**
For location or service matrices, ensure each page has:
- 500+ unique words minimum
- Location/service-specific details
- Unique images or examples
- Distinct value proposition
- Different testimonials or case studies

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

❌ Keyword stuffing (forcing keyword 15+ times)
❌ Unnatural phrasing to fit keywords
❌ Copying competitor content structure exactly
❌ Generic, template-feeling content
❌ No CTAs or conversion elements
❌ Walls of text (no formatting)
❌ Jargon without explanation
❌ Promises you can't keep
❌ Thin content just to check a box
❌ Ignoring search intent
❌ Missing meta tags or schema
❌ Internal links to irrelevant pages

## Quality Metrics

Content is successful when:
- Reads naturally to humans
- Includes keywords without feeling forced
- Answers the search query completely
- Unique compared to competitors
- Has clear conversion path
- Technically optimized (meta, schema, links)
- Requires minimal human editing
- Could rank within 3-6 months

## Integration with Other Skills

Works perfectly with:
- **seo-strategist** - Takes page briefs as input
- **docx skill** - Outputs formatted documents
- **web_search** - Research competitors and validate keywords
- **xlsx skill** - Batch processing from content calendars

## Example Workflow

**Input (from SEO Strategist):**
```
Page Type: Service Page
Primary Keyword: "emergency plumber boston"
Secondary Keywords: "24/7 plumber boston", "same day plumbing boston"
Intent: Transactional (high purchase intent)
User: Homeowner with urgent plumbing issue
Competitors: bostonplumbingpros.com (ranks #1), massplumbers.com (ranks #2)
Conversion Goal: Phone call booking
Brand Voice: Professional, trustworthy, fast
```

**Output (from Content Builder):**

1. **Complete page draft** with:
   - H1: "Emergency Plumber in Boston – 24/7 Same-Day Service"
   - 1,200 words optimized content
   - 3 CTAs (call buttons)
   - FAQ section with 8 Q&As
   - Trust signals (licensed, insured, 500+ 5-star reviews)
   
2. **SEO Checklist:**
   - Meta title: "Emergency Plumber Boston | 24/7 Same-Day Service – Call Now"
   - Schema: LocalBusiness + Service JSON-LD
   - 5 internal links mapped
   - 4 image suggestions with alt text
   - All technical requirements met

**Human Role:** Quick scan for accuracy, publish.

## Notes

- This skill creates the content, not the publishing workflow
- Assumes basic SEO knowledge in brief (keywords, intent)
- Quality control still recommended before publishing
- Use web search to validate competitors and refine angle
- Adjust formality/tone based on brand voice provided
- Always prioritize user experience over keyword density
- When in doubt, write for humans first, optimize for search second
