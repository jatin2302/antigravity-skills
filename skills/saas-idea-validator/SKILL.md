# SaaS Idea Validator

A framework for rigorously testing and validating B2B SaaS concepts, specifically those aimed at "boring but profitable" niches.

## When to Use This Skill
- Brainstorming new business ideas.
- Evaluating the feasibility of a product concept.
- Checking for "red flags" like platform dependency or high complexity.
- Validating market demand before writing code.

## Validation Criteria
1. **Complexity Check**: Can the MVP be built in < 1 month?
2. **Dependence Check**: Does it rely on a single platform API (e.g., Reddit, Twitter)? -> *Risk Factor*
3. **Problem Validation**: Is it solving a bleeding neck problem for a business?
4. **Market Size**: Is the niche reachable and willing to pay?
5. **Competition**: Is the market crowded or underserved?

## Usage
- "Evaluate my idea for an automated invoice reconciliation tool for plumbers."
- "What are the risks of building a tool dependent on the LinkedIn API?"
- "Help me differentiate my CRM idea from existing solutions."

## Output Format
- **Score (0-100)** based on sustainability metrics.
- **SWOT Analysis** (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats).
- **Go/No-Go Recommendation**.
