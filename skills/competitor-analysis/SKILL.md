# Competitor Analysis

Go beyond surface-level "feature comparison" to understand the strategic positioning of your competitors.

## When to Use This Skill
- Entering a new market niche.
- Refining your value proposition.
- Planning a marketing campaign against an incumbent.
- Pricing your product.

## Analysis Framework
1. **Positioning Audit**: How do they describe themselves (H1, meta tags)?
2. **Pricing Structure**: Tiers, limits, and "hidden" costs.
3. **Feature Wars**: What do they *claim* vs what they *deliver*? (Check reviews).
4. **GTM Reverse Engineering**: Where are they getting traffic? (Ads, SEO, Social).
5. **Review Mining**: What do customers hate about them? (Your opportunity).

## Usage
- "Analyze `competitor.com` and identify their 3 biggest weaknesses."
- "Compare the pricing models of Tool A vs Tool B for a small agency."
- "Find the most common complaints about our top 3 competitors on Capterra/G2."

## Output Format
- **Battlecard**: Quick reference for sales/positioning.
- **Feature Matrix**: Detailed comparison.
- **Attack Vectors**: Specific angles to win against them.
