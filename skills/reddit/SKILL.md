# Reddit Outreach & Brand Mention

**Purpose:** Find relevant Reddit threads and post strategic comments with brand mentions that drive traffic without getting banned.

A tactical Reddit marketing skill that identifies high-opportunity threads in your niche and generates authentic, value-adding comments that naturally incorporate your brand mention. Designed to avoid spam detection while building genuine brand awareness.

## Core Mission

Transform Reddit from random browsing into a systematic lead generation and brand awareness channel by:
- Finding threads where your audience is actively asking questions
- Crafting helpful comments that naturally mention your brand
- Avoiding spam patterns that get you banned
- Scaling Reddit engagement systematically

## When to Use This Skill

Trigger this skill when:
- Building brand awareness in specific niches
- Need traffic from Reddit to your site/product
- Finding people actively looking for solutions you provide
- Want to engage in niche communities strategically
- Need Reddit backlinks (for SEO)
- Monitoring brand mentions or competitor discussions
- Testing product-market fit through community feedback

## Required Inputs

**Minimum:**
1. **Product/Service** - What you're promoting
2. **Niche/Industry** - Target market (e.g., "SaaS project management", "fitness supplements")
3. **Brand name** - Your company/product name

**Ideal:**
- Target subreddits (if known)
- Key problems your product solves
- Competitor names (to find comparison threads)
- Target keywords (phrases people use when searching for solutions)
- Link to your site/product
- Brand positioning (how to describe what you do)

## Expected Outputs

### 1. Target Thread List

Curated list of Reddit threads with:
- **Thread URL** - Direct link
- **Subreddit** - Which community
- **Thread Title** - What the post is about
- **Opportunity Score** - High/Medium/Low (based on relevance + engagement)
- **Why it's relevant** - How it connects to your product
- **Comment angle** - Strategy for your response

**Example:**
```
Thread: "What's the best project management tool for small teams?"
Subreddit: r/startups
Posted: 3 hours ago
Upvotes: 47
Comments: 23
Opportunity: HIGH
Relevance: Direct product question, active discussion, OP still responding
Angle: Share honest comparison including your tool as option
```

### 2. Ready-to-Post Comment Drafts

For each thread, provide:
- **Comment text** - Full draft ready to post
- **Tone** - Helpful, conversational, authentic
- **Brand mention** - Naturally integrated (not forced)
- **Value-add** - Helpful info beyond just the pitch
- **Call-to-action** - Subtle (if appropriate)
- **Variation options** - 2-3 versions with different approaches

**Comment Quality Standards:**
✅ Reads like genuine community member, not marketer
✅ Adds real value to conversation
✅ Brand mention feels natural, not spammy
✅ Appropriate length (not too short, not essay-length)
✅ Matches Reddit tone/culture
✅ Follows subreddit rules

## Methodology

### Phase 1: Thread Discovery

**Search Strategies:**

**1. Direct Problem Searches:**
Use web search to find Reddit threads with patterns like:
- "[niche] recommendations reddit"
- "[problem] solution reddit"
- "best [product type] reddit"
- "[competitor name] alternative reddit"
- "struggling with [problem] reddit"

**Example Searches:**
- "project management software recommendations reddit"
- "best crm for small business reddit"
- "asana alternative reddit"
- "how to organize team tasks reddit"

**2. Subreddit Identification:**
Find relevant communities:
- **Direct niche subs:** r/[YourNiche] (e.g., r/ProjectManagement)
- **Adjacent subs:** r/Entrepreneur, r/SmallBusiness, r/SaaS
- **Problem-focused subs:** r/GetMotivated, r/Productivity
- **Audience subs:** r/Startups, r/SideProject
- **Comparison subs:** r/SoftwareRecommendations

**3. Keyword Monitoring:**
Search within subreddits for:
- "[your product category]"
- "[problem you solve]"
- "[competitor names]"
- "recommend", "suggestion", "looking for", "need help"

**4. Timing Considerations:**
Prioritize:
- **Recent threads** (posted within last 24-48 hours)
- **Active discussions** (OP still responding, new comments coming in)
- **Rising posts** (gaining traction but not yet blown up)
- Avoid: Posts older than 1 week (conversation is dead)

### Phase 2: Opportunity Scoring

**Evaluate each thread on:**

**Relevance (0-10):**
- 10: Person explicitly asking for solution you provide
- 7-9: Related problem, your product is valid answer
- 4-6: Tangentially related, can add value
- 1-3: Weak connection, forced mention
- 0: Not relevant

**Engagement Potential (0-10):**
- 10: New thread gaining traction, OP active
- 7-9: Moderate activity, some engagement
- 4-6: Low activity but still visible
- 1-3: Dead thread, no recent comments
- 0: Locked or archived

**Competition Level:**
- **Low:** Few or no comments, or poor quality responses
- **Medium:** Some good answers but room for better
- **High:** Many detailed responses, hard to stand out

**Risk Level:**
- **Low Risk:** Sub allows product mentions, discussion-focused
- **Medium Risk:** Gray area, need subtle approach
- **High Risk:** Anti-promotion sub, requires pure value-add

**Opportunity Score Formula:**
```
HIGH = Relevance 8+ AND Engagement 7+ AND Low competition
MEDIUM = Relevance 6+ OR Engagement 5+ 
LOW = Everything else
```

**Focus on HIGH and MEDIUM opportunities only.**

### Phase 3: Comment Crafting

**Structure for Effective Reddit Comments:**

**Opening (Build Credibility):**
- Acknowledge the question/problem
- Show you understand their situation
- Optional: Brief relevant personal experience

**Body (Provide Value):**
- Answer their question helpfully
- Share genuine insights or comparison
- Be honest about pros/cons
- Mention 2-3 options, not just yours

**Brand Mention (Natural Integration):**
- Introduce your product as one of several options
- Be transparent about your connection (if asked or relevant)
- Focus on specific use case where it fits
- Don't oversell or hype

**Closing (Soft CTA):**
- Offer to answer questions
- Provide link if contextually appropriate
- Keep it helpful, not pushy

**Example Structure:**

```
[OPENING - Empathy/Context]
"I've been in the same boat - managing a small team with too many tools and no single source of truth."

[BODY - Helpful Info]
"For your use case (under 10 people, need simple task tracking), I'd narrow it down to three options:

1. Trello - Super simple, great for visual people, free tier is generous
2. Asana - More features, good for workflows, free up to 15 people  
3. [Your Product] - We built this specifically for small teams who found Asana too complex"

[HONEST COMPARISON]
"Trello is probably the easiest to start with. Asana has more power if you need it. [Your Product] sits in between - less overwhelming than Asana but more structured than Trello."

[TRANSPARENCY]
"Full disclosure: I work on [Your Product], but genuinely - start with Trello if you want the simplest option. We're better if you're already using Trello and outgrowing it."

[SOFT CTA]
"Happy to answer questions about any of these if helpful!"
```

**Comment Length Guidelines:**
- **Minimum:** 3-4 sentences (too short = spam)
- **Optimal:** 2-3 short paragraphs (150-250 words)
- **Maximum:** 4-5 paragraphs (longer = people won't read)

**Tone Calibration by Subreddit:**

**Professional subs (r/Entrepreneur, r/SmallBusiness):**
- More formal
- Data/results focused
- Business case emphasis

**Casual subs (r/SideProject, r/SaaS):**
- Conversational
- Personal experience
- Honest and transparent

**Technical subs (r/Programming, r/DevOps):**
- Detailed and specific
- Technical accuracy critical
- Don't BS - they'll catch it

**Support subs (r/GetMotivated, r/ADHD):**
- Empathetic
- Focus on solving their problem
- Gentle product mention only if truly helpful

### Phase 4: Spam Avoidance

**What Gets You Banned:**

❌ **Immediate Red Flags:**
- Account created today, first post is product pitch
- Same comment copy-pasted across threads
- Only comment is brand link with no context
- Overly promotional language ("amazing", "best ever", "life-changing")
- Link dropping without explanation
- Ignoring subreddit rules (many ban self-promotion)

❌ **Suspicious Patterns:**
- Every comment mentions your product
- Never engage in other discussions
- Account only active in specific subreddits
- All comments have same structure
- Always linking to same site

✅ **How to Stay Safe:**

**Account Management:**
- Use aged accounts (3+ months old preferred)
- Build karma through genuine engagement first
- Comment on other topics too (not just promoting)
- Upvote and engage beyond your own threads

**Commenting Strategy:**
- Vary your comment structure and approach
- Don't mention brand in every single comment
- Sometimes just be helpful without mentioning product
- Engage with follow-up questions
- Upvote other helpful responses

**Frequency:**
- Don't comment on 10 threads in an hour
- Spread activity over days
- 2-5 quality comments per day max
- Build genuine community presence

**Transparency:**
- Disclose affiliation when directly asked
- Use phrases like "I work on X" or "We built Y"
- Don't pretend to be unbiased customer
- But also don't lead with "I'm a founder" unless relevant

### Phase 5: Link Strategy

**When to Include Links:**

**Safe to Link:**
- Someone explicitly asks for link/website
- Comparison table or resource list
- Educational content (guide, tool, resource)
- Thread specifically about sharing products/tools

**Risky to Link:**
- Unsolicited in thread that doesn't ask
- Your first comment in a subreddit
- Multiple links in one comment
- Link without context or explanation

**How to Link Safely:**

**Method 1: Wait for Ask**
```
[Your helpful comment without link]
↓
Someone replies: "What's the tool called?"
↓
You reply: "It's called [Product], happy to DM the link"
```

**Method 2: Soft Mention with Offer**
```
"We built [Product] for this exact use case. Not sure if links are allowed here, but happy to share if you DM me."
```

**Method 3: Context-Rich Link**
```
"Here's a comparison I wrote up of the top 5 options: [link to your blog post that includes your product alongside competitors]"
```

**Method 4: Add Value Beyond Link**
```
"I compared all these options here [link], but TLDR:
- If you need X, go with A
- If you need Y, go with B  
- If you need Z, we built C for that"
```

### Phase 6: Response Management

**After Posting:**

**Monitor for Replies:**
- Set Reddit alerts for comment replies
- Respond quickly (within 1-2 hours if possible)
- Answer follow-up questions helpfully
- Don't get defensive if criticized

**Handling Negative Responses:**

**If someone says "This is spam":**
- Don't argue or get defensive
- Acknowledge: "Fair point - tried to be helpful but may have missed the mark"
- Focus on answering their question if they have one
- Learn and adjust approach

**If someone asks about affiliation:**
- Be immediately transparent
- "Yep, I work on [Product] - tried to give honest comparison though"
- Don't backtrack or hide it
- Most Redditors respect transparency

**If someone shares bad experience with your product:**
- Thank them for feedback
- Don't dismiss or make excuses
- Offer to help resolve their issue (via DM)
- Shows you care about customers

**Engaging with Discussion:**
- Upvote other good answers
- Thank people who engage with your comment
- Contribute to side conversations
- Don't just drop comment and leave

## Best Practices

**Do:**
✅ Be genuinely helpful first, promotional second

✅ Engage in community beyond promoting
✅ Vary your approach across threads
✅ Follow subreddit-specific rules
✅ Respond to replies and questions

❌ Pretend to be unbiased when you're not
❌ Spam links without context
❌ Only engage when promoting
❌ Trash competitors
❌ Get defensive about criticism

## Risk Mitigation

**Account Strategy:**
- Use established accounts (3+ months old)
- Build karma in non-promotional ways first
- Don't have all activity be product-related
- Consider using personal account, not brand account

**Subreddit Strategy:**
- Read and follow each subreddit's rules
- Lurk before posting to understand culture
- Start with smaller, niche-specific subs
- Avoid highly moderated subs until experienced

**Comment Strategy:**
- Vary your approaches significantly
- Don't mention brand in every comment
- Space out comments (not all at once)
- Provide value even without mentioning product

**Link Strategy:**
- Only link when contextually appropriate
- Use non-affiliate, clean links
- Add value beyond just the link
- Consider waiting for someone to ask

## Success Metrics

**The Reddit strategy is working when:**
- ✅ Comments get upvotes, not downvotes
- ✅ People reply with questions (engagement)
- ✅ Traffic from Reddit increases
- ✅ No bans or warnings
- ✅ Positive brand mentions from others
- ✅ Other Redditors recommend your product unprompted
- ✅ Low bounce rate from Reddit traffic (they're interested)
- ✅ Conversions from Reddit visitors

## Integration Notes

**Works with:**
- **Web search** - Finding relevant threads
- **Content strategy** - Creating resources to link to
- **Brand monitoring** - Tracking mentions

**Workflow:**
1. Use this skill to find threads and draft comments
2. Review and personalize comments
3. Post strategically (spaced out over time)
4. Monitor and respond to engagement
5. Track results via analytics

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

❌ Automating comment posting (gets banned fast)
❌ Using brand new accounts for promotion
❌ Only mentioning your product, never others
❌ Ignoring negative feedback or criticism
❌ Copy-pasting same response to every thread
❌ Being overly salesy or promotional in tone
❌ Not disclosing affiliation when asked
❌ Posting in irrelevant subreddits for exposure
❌ Leading every comment with your product name
❌ Not participating in community genuinely

## Notes

- Reddit is community-first, not marketing-first
- Value-add must be genuine, not just vehicle for pitch
- One great comment beats 10 mediocre ones
- Building reputation takes time - don't rush it
- Transparency usually works better than stealth
- Getting banned from one sub can affect others
- Quality threads > quantity of comments
- Monitor and adapt based on what works
