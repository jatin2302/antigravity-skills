# SEO Strategist

Turn SEO chaos into executable, ranked plans. From keyword research to site architecture.

## When to Use This Skill
- Planning an SEO content strategy from scratch
- Organizing keyword research into actionable clusters
- Mapping service + location pages
- Analyzing competitor content gaps
- Designing internal linking architectures
- Creating monthly SEO execution plans

## Framework

### 1. Keyword Clustering
- Group keywords by **search intent** (informational, commercial, transactional, navigational)
- Cluster by **topic** (one page per cluster, no cannibalization)
- Prioritize by **difficulty vs opportunity** matrix

### 2. Page Mapping
- **Service Pages**: One per core service offering
- **Location Pages**: Service × Location matrix for local SEO
- **Blog Posts**: Informational keywords driving top-of-funnel traffic
- **Pillar Pages**: Hub content linking to cluster pages

### 3. Competitor Gap Analysis
- Identify keywords competitors rank for that you don't
- Find content types competitors use (listicles, guides, tools)
- Spot thin content opportunities (weak competitor pages)

### 4. Internal Linking Strategy
- Map hub-and-spoke relationships
- Identify orphan pages
- Create linking rules (contextual, navigation, footer)

### 5. Execution Plan
- Prioritized content calendar (quick wins first)
- Monthly deliverable checklist
- KPI tracking (rankings, traffic, conversions)

## Usage
