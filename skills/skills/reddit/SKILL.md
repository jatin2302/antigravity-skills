# Reddit Outreach

Find Reddit threads for natural brand mentions and generate authentic, value-first comments.

## When to Use This Skill
- Reddit marketing and brand awareness campaigns
- Finding threads where your product/service is relevant
- Generating traffic from Reddit organically
- Client Reddit promotion campaigns

## Workflow

### Step 1: Brand Input
- Product/service name and URL
- Key features and differentiators
- Target audience description
- Keywords and topics

### Step 2: Subreddit Discovery
- Identify 5-10 relevant subreddits
- Check subreddit rules (self-promo policies)
- Assess activity level and audience quality

### Step 3: Thread Discovery
Search for threads where:
- People ask for recommendations in your niche
- Competitors are mentioned (opportunity to differentiate)
- Pain points your product solves are discussed
- "What tool do you use for X?" type questions

### Step 4: Comment Generation
For each thread, generate a comment that:
- **Adds genuine value** (answer the question first)
- **Mentions the brand naturally** (not forced)
- **Matches the subreddit's tone** (casual vs professional)
- **Includes social proof** if available
- **Never sounds like an ad**

## Usage
- "Find Reddit threads where people need SEO services."
- "Generate 10 comment drafts mentioning FastestRank naturally."
- "What subreddits discuss digital marketing tools?"

## Rules
- Never spam — quality over quantity
- Respect subreddit rules
- Disclose affiliations when required
- Focus on helping, not selling
