1.  **Data Entry:** Get basic details of the client and upload them into the CRM.
2.  **Proposal:** Send proposals to the client.
3.  **Agreement:** Check if the client agrees with the proposal.
4.  **Contracts:** Make sure proposals or contracts are signed.
5.  **Invoicing:** Send the invoice and schedule the first onboarding welcome call.
6.  **Payment Verification:** Check if a 50% payment has been received. If yes, send a welcome email.
7.  **Information Gathering:** Send a questionnaire asking for more specific details.
8.  **Resource Request:** Request access to necessary resources (e.g., accounts, logos).
9.  **Resource Verification:** Check if the needed files, images, and resources have been received.
10. **Project Launch:** Confirm if the project has started.
11. **Planning:** Create a proper plan for the project.
12. **Scheduling:** Schedule future calls and set meeting points.
13. **Week 1 Milestone:** Confirm completion of the first week of the project.
14. **Week 2 Milestone:** Confirm completion of the second week.
15. **Mid-Project Update:** Conduct a follow-up call and report to the client.
16. **Week 3 Milestone:** Confirm completion of the third week.
